Small useful scripts.

**spotify_mute.py:** Mutes desktop Spotify when an advertisement plays. Very rudimentary, however: if there's any other window with "Advertisement" in the name, Spotify'll be muted!

**ffmpeg_track_merger.py:** With one or more video(s) as input (each having multiple audio tracks, e.g. one for system sounds and another for mic, as is common for screen recorders), this produces video(s) with merged audio tracks. Bitrate's mostly preserved, too
